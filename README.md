# Monopoly but Racism

## Introduction

This project seeks to create a monopoly game that uses legislation and historical events to portray how anti-Blackness in the United States can be interpreted as algorithmic.

This project is a form of data visualization, as it processes information including dates and social demographics within its function.

## How It Works

The content of the game is organized in a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qrpQ9sRVAXSYGE1xUnePQejPta22JbuvoJSY5gUC97Y/edit?usp=sharing), with different elements of the game corresponding to different sheets.

The core of the game is operated by Javascript and HTML. Nothing too complicated (hopefully)!

## Reflection
To be filled out at the end of the semester
